# Password-Protected Message Encryption and Decryption

This Python script allows you to encrypt a message using a special password and later decrypt it using the same password. The encryption key is stored securely, and the password is hashed before comparison, ensuring secure encryption and decryption processes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bcrypt cryptography
