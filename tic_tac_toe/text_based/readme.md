Text-based Tic Tac Toe in Python
--------------------------------

This is a simple text-based Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. To play, simply run the `main.py` file. You will then be prompted to enter your name and choose your symbol (X or O). Once you have done this, the game will begin.

To make a move, simply enter the row and column number of the square where you want to place your symbol. For example, to place your symbol in the top left corner, you would enter `1,1`.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is filled up and no one has won, the game is a draw.

How to build
------------

To build this game, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can build the game by running the following command:

```
python setup.py install

```

This will create a new directory called `dist`. Inside the `dist` directory, you will find the executable file for the game. To run the game, simply double-click on the executable file.
