Deep Neural Networks (DNN) - README.md
======================================

Overview
--------

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. These networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transform data. DNNs are widely used in various applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

Features
--------

-   Multiple Layers: DNNs consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains multiple neurons that process and transform the input data.

-   Activation Functions: Neurons in DNNs use activation functions to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.

-   Backpropagation: DNNs use the backpropagation algorithm to optimize the weights of the connections between neurons, minimizing the error between predicted and actual output.

-   Deep Learning: DNNs are a fundamental building block of deep learning models, allowing the training of complex and hierarchical representations of data.
