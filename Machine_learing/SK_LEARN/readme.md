Machine Learning with scikit-learn
==================================

This repository provides a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts using scikit-learn, one of the most popular Python libraries for machine learning. Here, we cover fundamental topics such as regression, classification, principal component analysis, and boosting.

Contents
--------

1.  Regression: Learn how to predict continuous outcomes using regression models. Understand the basics of linear regression and multiple linear regression. Predict numerical values based on input features.

2.  Classification: Explore classification algorithms to categorize data points into classes. Understand binary and multiclass classification. Learn about popular algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

3.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dive into dimensionality reduction techniques. Understand PCA, a method used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form. Visualize the data and improve model efficiency.

4.  Boosting: Understand boosting algorithms to improve the accuracy of machine learning models. Learn about AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting. Boost weak learners into strong learners by combining them.
