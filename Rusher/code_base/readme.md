# CODE BASE 

Welcome to the code repository for the RUSHER game project! In this repository, you will find individual code files for different functionalities, specifically related to the "fire" and "spikes" features of our application. These code files are separated here for better understanding, organization, and future reference.

## Folder Structure

- **`/fire`**: This directory contains all the code files related to the "fire" functionality. You'll find modules, scripts, and resources specific to the fire feature of our application.

- **`/spikes`**: Inside this directory, you'll discover code files associated with the "spikes" functionality. This includes components, styles, and logic related to the spikes feature.

## Why Separate Code Files?

Separating the code into individual directories enhances clarity and maintainability. It allows developers to focus on specific features without getting overwhelmed by the entire codebase. This organization also simplifies collaboration and future modifications.

## How to Use?

Feel free to navigate into the respective directories (`/fire` and `/spikes`) to explore the code files. Each directory contains self-contained code snippets and modules related to its specific functionality.
